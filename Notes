HPA:
----

HPA is Horizontal pod autoscaler which increases the no. of replicas based on CPU and memory utilization.

Metrics server is required for HPA which captures metrics 

It takes sometime for metrics to be reflected in hpa.

By default 5 mins is the cooldown period.

cpu and memory limits has to be set in order to configure hpa and scale with memory.

Issue:-
------
Metrics server unable to capture metrics properly, if it HA is not setup 

Hpa was unable to fetch memory when app was deployed with argocd due to API version issue

Resolution:
-----------
change the apiversion from autoscaling/v2 to autoscaling v2beta1 when app is deployed using argocd.

VPA:
====

VPA is vertical pod autoscalar which increases/decreases the resources of a pod by destroying old pod and creating a new pod.

VPA is not installed by default in the cluster. Its a custom resource definition. Hence, it has to be installed separately.

3 components which get deployed as a part it are :-

1. Recommender             # recommends the change in pods resource request required
2. Admission Controller    # connect with apiserver to get the config for vpa
3. Updater                 # update the resource recommended by recommender

Sample yaml:
-----------
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1         # api version which needs to be present
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler               # will be deployed as apart of crd
metadata:
  name: my-rec-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:                              # defining the target resource
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"                 # api version of the object
    kind:       Deployment                # target object type
    name:       my-rec-deployment         # target object name
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Off"                     # off is when it recommendation but doesnt update
                                          # auto updates the pods as well

Prometheus is having three components:-
--------------------------------------
1. Http Server
2. Retrieval
3. storage


Http server is used for getting metrics from storage by prometheus
Retrieval is used to fetch metrics from pods. It uses a pull mechanism
only with short lived process push mechanism is used


Install Prometheus using helm
==============================

1. Add a repo 
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

2. Update repo 
   helm repo update

3. Install kube Prometheus stack which includes alert manager, grafana, prometheus operator, state metrics, prometheus, node exporter.
    
    helm install <name> prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack  -n <namespace>

Service Monitor : Service monitor describes the set of targets to be monitored by Prometheus.
---------------

List of the service monitor
---------------------------

kubectl get servicemonitor


label release: prometheus is very important in the service monitor as prometheus find the service monitor and registers to the server and starts scarping


Exporter is a translator which converts application data to prometheus understandable metrics and expose /metrics 
-------- for prometheus to scrape

Node Exporter translater the metrics of the cluster nodes
