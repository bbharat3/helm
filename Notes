HPA:
----
Metrics server is required for HPA which captures metrics 

It takes sometime for metrics to be reflected in hpa.

By default 5 mins is the cooldown period.

Issue:-
Metrics server unable to capture metrics properly, if it HA is not setup 

Prometheus is having three components:-
--------------------------------------
1. Http Server
2. Retrieval
3. storage


Http server is used for getting metrics from storage by prometheus
Retrieval is used to fetch metrics from pods. It uses a pull mechanism
only with short lived process push mechanism is used
