HPA:
----
Metrics server is required for HPA which captures metrics 

It takes sometime for metrics to be reflected in hpa.

By default 5 mins is the cooldown period.

Issue:-
------
Metrics server unable to capture metrics properly, if it HA is not setup 

Prometheus is having three components:-
--------------------------------------
1. Http Server
2. Retrieval
3. storage


Http server is used for getting metrics from storage by prometheus
Retrieval is used to fetch metrics from pods. It uses a pull mechanism
only with short lived process push mechanism is used


Install Prometheus using helm
==============================

1. Add a repo 
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

2. Update repo 
   helm repo update

3. Install kube Prometheus stack which includes alert manager, grafana, prometheus operator, state metrics, prometheus, node exporter.
    
    helm install <name> prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack  -n <namespace>

Service Monitor : Service monitor describes the set of targets to be monitored by Prometheus.
---------------

List of the service monitor
---------------------------

kubectl get servicemonitor


label release: prometheus is very important in the service monitor as prometheus find the service monitor and registers to the server and starts scarping


Exporter is a translator which converts application data to prometheus understandable metrics and expose /metrics 
-------- for prometheus to scrape

Node Exporter translater the metrics of the cluster nodes
